# The Incredible Machine — Web Clone

A browser-based Rube Goldberg puzzle game inspired by the 1993 classic by Jeff Tunnell Productions / Dynamix / Sierra On-Line.

## 🎮 How to Play

Place objects on the board to build a chain-reaction machine that achieves the level goal. Hit **Play** to watch your contraption in action. If it doesn't work, **Reset** and try again!

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test
```

## 🤝 Multi-Agent Development

This project is developed using a two-agent parallel workflow:

- **Agent A** (`agent-a/engine-and-objects`): Physics engine + all 15 game objects
- **Agent B** (`agent-b/ui-and-puzzles`): UI shell, puzzle system, level editor

Both agents branch from `main` (shared scaffold), develop independently, and merge via pull requests.

## 📋 Tech Stack

- **Vite** — Build tool / dev server
- **Matter.js** — 2D physics engine
- **HTML5 Canvas** — Rendering
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — ES Modules, no frameworks
- **Vitest** — Unit testing
